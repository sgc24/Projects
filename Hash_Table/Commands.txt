COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  this program uses c++ 11 compiler
  
  it compiles using:  g++ -std=c++11 mp_9364.cpp -o mp9364
  it then executes by: ./mp_9364 command.txt
  
EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    for file: 'arbitrary file name'.txt
    
    this program takes one command line argument: an arbitrary file name
    inside the file:
      commands must be typed at the start of each line with exactly one space between the next command.
      No tabs, just a single space between them.
      Nothing is typed before or after them. 
      ex:
          14 10
          10 alex
          10 john
          13
    
    
BUG REPORT
  This program cannot function if the first command in the txt file IS NOT a 14(the create operation)
  for example this works:
                            14 20
                            10 alex
                            10 john
                            13
                            
  this will not work:
                        10 alex
                        14 20
                        10 john        
                        13
                        
  A 14 has to be present and has to be on the first line of the txt file
  The command 14 CANNOT be present in more than one line. It only occurs
  once, at the start of the txt file.
